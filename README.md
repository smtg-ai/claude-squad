# Claude Squad [![CI](https://github.com/smtg-ai/claude-squad/actions/workflows/build.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/smtg-ai/claude-squad/actions/workflows/build.yml) [![GitHub Release](https://img.shields.io/github/v/release/smtg-ai/claude-squad)](https://github.com/smtg-ai/claude-squad/releases/latest)

[Claude Squad](https://smtg-ai.github.io/claude-squad/) is a terminal app that manages multiple [Claude Code](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code), [Codex](https://github.com/openai/codex), [Gemini](https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli) (and other local agents including [Aider](https://github.com/Aider-AI/aider)) in separate workspaces, allowing you to work on multiple tasks simultaneously.

### Highlights
- Complete tasks in the background (including yolo / auto-accept mode!)
- Manage instances and tasks in one terminal window
- Review changes before applying them, checkout changes before pushing them
- Each task gets its own isolated git workspace, so no conflicts

<b>Using Claude Squad with other AI assistants:</b>
- For [Codex](https://github.com/openai/codex): Set your API key with `export OPENAI_API_KEY=<your_key>`
- Launch with specific assistants:
   - Codex: `cs -p "codex"`
   - Aider: `cs -p "aider ..."`
   - Gemini: `cs -p "gemini"`
- Make this the default, by modifying the config file (locate with `cs debug`)

### FAQs

#### Failed to start new session

If you get an error like `failed to start new session: timed out waiting for tmux session`, update the
underlying program (ex. `claude`) to the latest version.

### How It Works

1. **tmux** to create isolated terminal sessions for each agent
2. **git worktrees** to isolate codebases so each session works on its own branch
3. A simple TUI interface for easy navigation and management
