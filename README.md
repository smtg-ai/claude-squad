# Claude Squad [![CI](https://github.com/smtg-ai/claude-squad/actions/workflows/build.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/smtg-ai/claude-squad/actions/workflows/build.yml) [![GitHub Release](https://img.shields.io/github/v/release/smtg-ai/claude-squad)](https://github.com/smtg-ai/claude-squad/releases/latest)

[Claude Squad](https://smtg-ai.github.io/claude-squad/) is a terminal app that manages multiple [Claude Code](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code), [Codex](https://github.com/openai/codex), [Gemini](https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli) (and other local agents including [Aider](https://github.com/Aider-AI/aider)) in separate workspaces, allowing you to work on multiple tasks simultaneously.

### Highlights
- Complete tasks in the background (including yolo / auto-accept mode!)
- Manage instances and tasks in one terminal window
- Review changes before applying them, checkout changes before pushing them
- Each task gets its own isolated git workspace, so no conflicts

> **Note:** This is a personal fork of [smtg-ai/claude-squad](https://github.com/smtg-ai/claude-squad), maintained because upstream development has stopped. Install from this fork rather than Homebrew or the upstream install script.

### Installation

Install with a single command (clones the fork, builds from source, installs to `~/.local/bin`, and sets up the `cs` alias):

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rakesh97/claude-squad/main/install.sh | bash
```

The script installs the required dependencies (`go`, `git`, `tmux`, `gh`) via your system package manager if they're missing, caches the source tree at `~/.cache/claude-squad-src`, and builds the binary with `go build`.

Re-run the same command at any time to update to the latest `main`.

Environment overrides:

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `BIN_DIR` | `$HOME/.local/bin` | Where the binary is installed |
| `SRC_DIR` | `$HOME/.cache/claude-squad-src` | Where the source is cached |
| `INSTALL_NAME` | `claude-squad` | Binary name |
| `BRANCH` | `main` | Branch to build from |
| `NO_ALIAS` | _(unset)_ | Set to any value to skip creating the `cs` alias |

Example — skip the alias and install under a custom name:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rakesh97/claude-squad/main/install.sh \
  | NO_ALIAS=1 INSTALL_NAME=my-cs bash
```

#### Migrating from the Homebrew version

If you previously ran `brew install claude-squad`, remove it and its `cs` symlink first, otherwise the old version will shadow this one:

```bash
brew uninstall claude-squad
rm -f "$(brew --prefix)/bin/cs"
```

Also remove any existing `alias cs=...` line from your shell rc file — the install script will add a fresh one pointing at the new binary.

### Prerequisites

- [tmux](https://github.com/tmux/tmux/wiki/Installing)
- [gh](https://cli.github.com/)

### Usage

```
Usage:
  cs [flags]
  cs [command]

Available Commands:
  completion  Generate the autocompletion script for the specified shell
  debug       Print debug information like config paths
  help        Help about any command
  reset       Reset all stored instances
  version     Print the version number of claude-squad

Flags:
  -y, --autoyes          [experimental] If enabled, all instances will automatically accept prompts for claude code & aider
  -h, --help             help for claude-squad
  -p, --program string   Program to run in new instances (e.g. 'aider --model ollama_chat/gemma3:1b')
```

Run the application with:

```bash
cs
```
NOTE: The default program is `claude` and we recommend using the latest version.

<b>Using Claude Squad with other AI assistants:</b>
- For [Codex](https://github.com/openai/codex): Set your API key with `export OPENAI_API_KEY=<your_key>`
- Launch with specific assistants:
   - Codex: `cs -p "codex"`
   - Aider: `cs -p "aider ..."`
   - Gemini: `cs -p "gemini"`
- Make this the default, by modifying the config file (locate with `cs debug`)

<br />

#### Menu
The menu at the bottom of the screen shows available commands: 

##### Instance/Session Management
- `n` - Create a new session
- `N` - Create a new session with a prompt
- `D` - Kill (delete) the selected session
- `↑/j`, `↓/k` - Navigate between sessions

##### Actions
- `↵/o` - Attach to the selected session to reprompt
- `ctrl-q` - Detach from session
- `s` - Commit and push branch to github
- `c` - Checkout. Commits changes and pauses the session
- `r` - Resume a paused session
- `?` - Show help menu

##### Navigation
- `tab` - Switch between preview tab and diff tab
- `q` - Quit the application
- `shift-↓/↑` - scroll in diff view

### Configuration

Claude Squad stores its configuration in `~/.claude-squad/config.json`. You can find the exact path by running `cs debug`.

#### Profiles

Profiles let you define multiple named program configurations and switch between them when creating a new session. When more than one profile is defined, the session creation overlay shows a profile picker that you can navigate with `←`/`→`.

To configure profiles, add a `profiles` array to your config file and set `default_program` to the name of the profile to select by default:

```json
{
  "default_program": "claude",
  "profiles": [
    { "name": "claude", "program": "claude" },
    { "name": "codex", "program": "codex" },
    { "name": "aider", "program": "aider --model ollama_chat/gemma3:1b" }
  ]
}
```

Each profile has two fields:

| Field     | Description                                              |
|-----------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| `name`    | Display name shown in the profile picker                 |
| `program` | Shell command used to launch the agent for that profile  |

If no profiles are defined, Claude Squad uses `default_program` directly as the launch command (the default is `claude`).

### FAQs

#### Failed to start new session

If you get an error like `failed to start new session: timed out waiting for tmux session`, update the
underlying program (ex. `claude`) to the latest version.

### How It Works

1. **tmux** to create isolated terminal sessions for each agent
2. **git worktrees** to isolate codebases so each session works on its own branch
3. A simple TUI interface for easy navigation and management
