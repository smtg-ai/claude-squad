  name: Story Implementation - Epic to PR Ready
  description: >-
    Complete story implementation workflow from epic context to PR delivery with learning extraction and MANDATORY epic retrospectives.
    Phase 1: Story Preparation (Epic + Story Number → Story Ready for Development)
    Phase 2: Implementation (Story Development with Validation)
    Phase 3: Quality Review (Architecture, Business, and QA Validation)
    Phase 4: Learning Extraction (Triage + Collaborative Review)
    Phase 5: Commit and PR Preparation (Context Generation)
    Phase 6: PR Creation and Epic Progress (Delivery + Tracking)
    Phase 7: Epic Retrospective (MANDATORY when epic reaches 100% completion)
